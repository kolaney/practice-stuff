Implement a function to check in a single pass, if the given singly-linked list has an even or an odd number of nodes in it.

An Empty list has 0 nodes which makes the number of nodes in it even.

Examples: 

Linkedlist: 1->2->3->4

head=1

is_list_even(head) => true



Linkedlist: 1->2->3->4->5

head=1

is_list_even(head) => false
